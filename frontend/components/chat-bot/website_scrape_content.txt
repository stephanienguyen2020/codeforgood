Grace's Story

 Gracie Firestone, Tower Hill 2011, Survivor of Sudden Cardiac Arrest

Grace Firestone, Tower Hill School, 2011, was selected as a 2012 recipient of the “National High School Spirit of Sport Award” by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).

The National High School Spirit of Sport Award was created to recognize those individuals who exemplify the ideals of the spirit of sport that represent the core mission of education-based athletics. Grace - one of eight recipients from across the country - was the winner of Section 2, which includes DE, Washington D.C, KY, MD, Ohio, PA, VA and WVA.

Additionally, in November of 2012, she was honored with the Youth in Philanthropy Award by the Brandywine Chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals.

An elite high school athlete, Grace earned 15 varsity letters and garnered All-state honors in all of her three sports, including 1st Team All State soccer for 3 years. She was a 6-time sports captain and maintained a 3.93 GPA. She was student body president her senior year. She created a number of community service projects while in high school, including “Let the Kids Play,” which later would raise thousands of dollars for her adopted orphanage in Kenya.

On June 6, 2011, just two days after graduating from Tower Hill, Grace went to her mother’s room to say that she wasn’t feeling well. Seconds later she collapsed on the bed. Her heart stopped. Her mother immediately called 911. Her brother Grant administered CPR during the three minutes before the New Castle County (DE) EMS arrived. NCC Policeman Officer Justison was first on the scene, directing the incoming emergency personnel. (Officer Justison was later to visit Gracie in the hospital several times. The EMS team visited as well.)Grace was paddled 6 times. The EMS team drilled into her shin (interosseous) to provide quicker IV access to the brain. Her heart stopped three times that night. On the way to Christiana Hospital she stopped breathing. An hour later, in an ER room, a doctor gets on his knee in front of Gracie's family. "There's a good chance we will lose her".  Gracie was put on a ventilator and an induced coma. Ten days later Grace left Christiana with an implanted defibrillator (ICD). No permanent damage. She began walking and working out.  She entered U of Delaware Honors in September 2011.  The doctor who implanted the defib/pacemaker warned again engaging in contact sports.  But these were the sports in which she thrived in high school. Gracie decided to live her own life.After a few months of physical and cognitive rehabilitation, she felt more than ever that she needed to help others. “Once I realized I was OK, I was frustrated with people telling me I wasn’t OK,” she says. “That gave me the inspiration to do something drastic to show I was physically and mentally able.” With the aid of US Sen Chris Coons and wife Annie, Grace created a fund raiser collecting $8,000.00 which eventually went to her adopted orphanage in Kenya. On Christmas Day 2012, Gracie left for Africa. She climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. While in Africa, Grace visited the orphanage and played soccer with the kids.At U of Delaware, she has played center mid position for UD Club Soccer. The team went to the national club soccer finals all 4 years.Through the efforts of Gracie, State Sens. Cathy Cloutier, Bethany Hall-Long and Kevin Charles of the DIAA (DE Interscholastic Athletic Assoc.), the Grace Firestone SCA Awareness Act was passed in 2014.Dr. Grace Firestone is a resident in family care at Stanford Medical Center -  O'Connor Hospital in CA Stanford - O'Connor Family Medicine Residency. Dr. Firestone graduated from the Sydney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. 

Article from Delaware Today magazine

Grace Firestone Act

The Important Legislation

Surrounded by student athletes from Middletown High School on the first day of school, Governor Markell signed legislation that requires the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (“DIAA”) to draft regulations to identify symptoms and risk factors of sudden cardiac arrest in student athletes. The legislation aims to better identify at-risk students who participate in youth sports and raise awareness among coaches and administrators. Senate Bill 205, which notes that Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the number one cause of death of student athletes while participating in practices and games, also helps ensure schools are better prepared to respond quickly and effectively should an incident occur.

"Youth and high school athletics offer a phenomenal opportunity for students to learn life skills -- good sportsmanship, teamwork, overcoming adversity -- while also providing them with regular exercise that promotes their physical health and well-being,” said Governor Markell. “We must take responsibility for doing everything we can to promote the health and safety of these athletes and Senate Bill 205 recognizes that we have the ability to greatly diminish the threat of sudden cardiac arrest. Today marks important progress in ensuring Delaware schools are better equipped to prevent and respond to this frightening condition."

Article from Delaware.gov

Article from the Newark Post

As a result of this law, the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association will develop rules for schools to deal with awareness, recognition, and management of sudden cardiac arrest in student-athletes. At a minimum, each school must give coaches and officials information on sudden cardiac arrest, including warning signs.In addition, students and their families will need to sign a sudden cardiac arrest information sheet; athletes will answer questions about heart history before they participate; and schools will ensure all head coaches undergo CPR certification that includes training on the use of an automated external defibrillator.

Words From Our SponsorsBill sponsor Sen. Bethany Hall-Long, D-Middletown, said the law reinforces actions already being taken by the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association. Hall-Long, who authored a law requiring screenings for athletes who may have suffered a concussion, has been on the forefront of protecting the health of young athletes.“Thanks to the tireless efforts of health advocacy groups and of Grace and the Firestone family, we’re here to provide new protection for young athletes,” Hall-Long said “With the training and information this law requires, we’re going to give young athletes a better chance of surviving, if they should suffer a sudden, unexpected cardiac incident while they’re on the field.”

Our Impact“Today, Delaware joined the increasingly pertinent nation-wide movement to provide high-school coaches, parents, and students with lifesaving CPR information,” Firestone said. “Because of persistent legislators and organizations dedicated to raising SCA awareness, Delaware is working to shift the balance to make SCA survival less of a far-reaching miracle and more of a prevailing standard. I will continue to live in gratitude for those family members, policemen, and EMT's who never gave up on my life, and promise to forever work with passion, heart, and purpose to pay that commitment forward.”She attends the University of Delaware and has started a charity to provide athletic equipment to disadvantaged children. At the bill signing, Markell said her story "reminds us why we’re here and it helps inspire us to see that we can do more to protect our kids."At the signing of The Grace Firestone Act is the 9th such bill in the nation. As of November of 2105 there were ONLY NINE states with similar legislation. THAT IS RIDICULOUS.For those from other states who would wish information for your legislators, please connect with me! This is a wonderfully collaborative bill, molded by all the statewide stakeholders AND budget neutral.

Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, co-sponsored the measure, which he hopes will protect young athletes.“It’s shocking to think that these sudden, unexpected heart attacks are the No. 1 killer of young athletes, but that’s the case,” Townsend said. “We know that, in some cases, quick reaction can save the lives of these young people which is why I supported the training this law will require.”Added Sen. Cathy Cloutier, R-Heatherbrooke, “As a member of the General Assembly, it is my responsibility to work on and promote legislation that will serve the people of Delaware, including student athletes. I am honored to have had the opportunity to play a role in SB 205. Because of this bill that’s being signed today, young lives in our state will be saved.”Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek South, also a co-sponsor of the bill, stated, “As a person who has dedicated his entire adult life to running health and fitness clubs and sports programs for our young athletes, I am very proud to have helped champion this important legislation. I believe that we are making a life-saving commitment to our student athletes and their families by enacting this bill.”SB 205 is known as the Grace Firestone Act, named for a former three-sport star at Tower Hill, who also excelled in the classroom, exemplifying the value that athletics can have as part of the educational experience. Now Grace, who attended the bill signing, is one of the rare survivors of Sudden Cardiac Arrest, having collapsed in her home two days after her high school graduation.

Greer Firestone Biography

A phone call at midnight. "Grace had a heart attack". NO! That could not happen to an elite athlete. There was no family heart history. We soon learned that Grace suffered not a heart attack but Sudden Cardiac Arrest. What was that? 

SCA is entirely different. If one is not given CPR/AED within 5 minutes....yes, 5 minutes, the patient either succumbs or suffers cognitive issues and will never be the same.       We did research. We gathered all the stakeholders in Delaware and created The Grace Firestone Act for Sudden Cardiac Awareness, mandated in 2014. However, that was not enough.

We founded Heart In The Game.org that same year to give Delaware students EKG screenings and to train in CPR/AED. 

A pre-participation physical for sports identifies 8% of heart abnormalities. Family history identifies 20%. A simple, 5 minute, non-invasive EKG identifies 90%. Yes, an EKG can save one life. Knowledge of CPR/AED can save tens of lives.

Parents think their otherwise healthy looking kids are invulnerable. The Firestone family certainly thought Grace was invulnerable. You never know. Why take the chance?

Schedule a Screening TodayA pediatric cardiologist or cardiologist volunteering to serve on HITG's Medical Advisory Team interprets each ECG heart screening. These are national experts specifically trained on how to read ECG heart screenings for athletes based on the International Criteria.Students must be 8 - 23 years old to participate in our heart screening program.



Heart Screening FAQs

 Why should my child get a heart screening? 

A simple heart screening can help detect problems before they become major medical issues. We strongly recommend all student athletes get an ECG. Athletes are 2-3 X's prone to SCA than regular students.

 How is the heart screening done? 

It all begins with an idea. Maybe you want to launch a business. Maybe you want to turn a hobby into something more.

 Who reads the ECG? 

Every ECG is read by board-certified Cardiologists who are among the most experienced and qualified doctors in the country. Their experience means more accurate interpretations.

 How often do you find a problem? 

On average 97% of all those screened have a normal ECG and are considered at low risk for cardiac issues. In less than 3%, results are inconclusive or suggest something that requires further testing. Most often an Echocardiogram (Echo) is recommended. The Echo is used to get a picture of the heart similar to an ultrasound to look at a baby during pregnancy. The Echo looks for valve and vein structure, muscle thickness, and proper operation of the heart. Most rarely, but most importantly, our statistics show that 1 in 1000 of those we screen will be flagged as high risk with a severe abnormality on their ECG.

 What if my child needs a follow up? 

Results are evaluated by our nationwide pediatric cardiologists. If your child has an abnormal finding, here is the procedure: - We suggest a second screening (just to make sure). - We connect with you and your pediatrician to inform both parties - If the results are the same, we send both parties a pdf of the screening - HITG then follows up with both parties - If the child is at risk, we reach out to the AD of his/her school - After all the abnormal results are sent to the family, HITG does a free and clear email to everyone else

 Will I see the results of my child's ECG? 

If there is a cause for concern, HITG will contact you and your pediatrician with a pdf of the screening. After you speak to the pediatrician, we will ask for a follow up from him or her. After we connect with parents and pediatricians for those with abnormalities, we will send a FREE and CLEAR email to all those families. I If you wish a pdf of the EKG, we will be happy to send one. (Some parents like to have it as a baseline, even if the child is free and clear).

 What if my child is considered "High Risk"? 

If your child is flagged as high risk, it is like a red traffic light. He or she should not participate in sports or high-energy activities in any way (practice, games, scrimmages, etc.) until he or she has seen a specialist and received clearance or treatment. If there is High Risk, we will reach out to the AD of the school.Item description

 What if I don't receive my results 

Occasionally results are blocked by spam folders or there is input error on the correct email. Please contact us here to request a copy of your results.

 Do we need to do this every year? 

ECG screening should be part of the physical every two years through middle school and high school due to the physical changes and increased stresses on a student athlete's heart, which occur during that time frame. However, encourage your children to be open and honest about how they physically feel and if at any time your child begins to experience any of the symptoms listed above, take immediate action with your child's physician.

 How is COVID-19 affecting our heart screenings? 

COVID-19 is affecting our screening's in several ways: • Increase costs due to PPE and sanitation supplies. • Increase in sanitation time as we're sanitizing between each participant. • We are keeping our pre-registration numbers at a safe count in order to practice safe distancing between participants. • We are requiring face masks for all invovled in our heart screening program. • We are asking that everyone keep a safe distance from each other at 6 feet apart. • We are limiting the number of persons allowed to go back into the screening room. • 1 in 7 athletes who contract COVID-19 have myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle)

 What is HITG COVID-19 safety protocols? 

We are determined to follow CDC guidelines and extend them. • We ask that everyone must wear a mask at all times. • Temperatures will be taken before anyone is allowed to enter and a questionnaire will be asked to verify every individuals health. These results will determine if a patient is allowed to continue with screen. • Please sanitize your hands before signing in. • Everyone must stay 6ft apart. • 1 Parent or guardian may come into the screening area with the patient. • Every table will be sanitized after every participant is finished. • Every machine will be wiped down and sanitized in between every participant. • Volunteers must sanitize hands in between every participant.

 How does a heart in the game screening work? 

• If we stage an In-school event, we coordinate the program through a nurse or athletic director. • HITG nurses/techs perform the screenings. • Results are interpreted by pediatric cardiologists.. If there is a cause for concern, HITG contacts the parents and pediatrician for appropriate care. Otherwise, after all are evaluated, HITG sends an all clear message to parents (or those 18 and over).

 How much will this cost? 

The screening costs $20. A typical doctor’s appointment with ECG normally costs $150 and up. Part of our mission is to serve the underserved communities of Delaware, Title 1 schools for example. If we stage either an IN school event at a non-Title 1 school or a community-wide event in a non-underserved area, the cost to sponsor an event is $2500.00. This amount might be arranged through an individual donation, a corporate sponsor or an athletic Booster Club.

 Isn't this covered with the annual physical? 

No. The annual physical exam asks family history questions, and requires a doctor to listen to the student’s heart with a stethoscope. Studies have shown that this is just 8% effective in catching heart issues. An ECG can detect up to 92% of the conditions that cause SCA. Heart In The Game charges $20/screening

 Are boys and girls screened together? 

No. Arrangements are made for privacy. Boys will remove their shirts. Girls should wear a regular bra, which will not need to be removed. Everyone should wear loose fitting clothes.Not to worry...our nurses are WONDERFUL! They have been with us for years. They love kids! That's why they are nurses!

The Difference Between Heart Attack and SCA

HEART ATTACKA heart attack occurs when a blocked artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching a section of the heart. If the blocked artery is not reopened quickly, the part of the heart normally nourished by that artery begins to die. The longer a person goes without treatment, the greater the damage. Symptoms of a heart attack may be immediate and intense. More often, though, symptoms start slowly and persist for hours, days or weeks before a heart attack. Unlike with sudden cardiac arrest, the heart usually does not stop beating during a heart attack. The heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men. 

SCASudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). With its pumping action disrupted, the heart cannot pump blood to the brain, lungs and other organs. Seconds later, a person loses consciousness and has no pulse. Death occurs within minutes if the victim does not receive treatment.

Grace's Story

 Gracie Firestone, Tower Hill 2011, Survivor of Sudden Cardiac Arrest

Grace Firestone, Tower Hill School, 2011, was selected as a 2012 recipient of the “National High School Spirit of Sport Award” by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).

The National High School Spirit of Sport Award was created to recognize those individuals who exemplify the ideals of the spirit of sport that represent the core mission of education-based athletics. Grace - one of eight recipients from across the country - was the winner of Section 2, which includes DE, Washington D.C, KY, MD, Ohio, PA, VA and WVA.

Additionally, in November of 2012, she was honored with the Youth in Philanthropy Award by the Brandywine Chapter of the Association of Fundraising Professionals.

An elite high school athlete, Grace earned 15 varsity letters and garnered All-state honors in all of her three sports, including 1st Team All State soccer for 3 years. She was a 6-time sports captain and maintained a 3.93 GPA. She was student body president her senior year. She created a number of community service projects while in high school, including “Let the Kids Play,” which later would raise thousands of dollars for her adopted orphanage in Kenya.

On June 6, 2011, just two days after graduating from Tower Hill, Grace went to her mother’s room to say that she wasn’t feeling well. Seconds later she collapsed on the bed. Her heart stopped. Her mother immediately called 911. Her brother Grant administered CPR during the three minutes before the New Castle County (DE) EMS arrived. NCC Policeman Officer Justison was first on the scene, directing the incoming emergency personnel. (Officer Justison was later to visit Gracie in the hospital several times. The EMS team visited as well.)Grace was paddled 6 times. The EMS team drilled into her shin (interosseous) to provide quicker IV access to the brain. Her heart stopped three times that night. On the way to Christiana Hospital she stopped breathing. An hour later, in an ER room, a doctor gets on his knee in front of Gracie's family. "There's a good chance we will lose her".  Gracie was put on a ventilator and an induced coma. Ten days later Grace left Christiana with an implanted defibrillator (ICD). No permanent damage. She began walking and working out.  She entered U of Delaware Honors in September 2011.  The doctor who implanted the defib/pacemaker warned again engaging in contact sports.  But these were the sports in which she thrived in high school. Gracie decided to live her own life.After a few months of physical and cognitive rehabilitation, she felt more than ever that she needed to help others. “Once I realized I was OK, I was frustrated with people telling me I wasn’t OK,” she says. “That gave me the inspiration to do something drastic to show I was physically and mentally able.” With the aid of US Sen Chris Coons and wife Annie, Grace created a fund raiser collecting $8,000.00 which eventually went to her adopted orphanage in Kenya. On Christmas Day 2012, Gracie left for Africa. She climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. While in Africa, Grace visited the orphanage and played soccer with the kids.At U of Delaware, she has played center mid position for UD Club Soccer. The team went to the national club soccer finals all 4 years.Through the efforts of Gracie, State Sens. Cathy Cloutier, Bethany Hall-Long and Kevin Charles of the DIAA (DE Interscholastic Athletic Assoc.), the Grace Firestone SCA Awareness Act was passed in 2014.Dr. Grace Firestone is a resident in family care at Stanford Medical Center -  O'Connor Hospital in CA Stanford - O'Connor Family Medicine Residency. Dr. Firestone graduated from the Sydney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

Grace Firestone Act

The Important Legislation

Surrounded by student athletes from Middletown High School on the first day of school, Governor Markell signed legislation that requires the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (“DIAA”) to draft regulations to identify symptoms and risk factors of sudden cardiac arrest in student athletes. The legislation aims to better identify at-risk students who participate in youth sports and raise awareness among coaches and administrators. Senate Bill 205, which notes that Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the number one cause of death of student athletes while participating in practices and games, also helps ensure schools are better prepared to respond quickly and effectively should an incident occur.

"Youth and high school athletics offer a phenomenal opportunity for students to learn life skills -- good sportsmanship, teamwork, overcoming adversity -- while also providing them with regular exercise that promotes their physical health and well-being,” said Governor Markell. “We must take responsibility for doing everything we can to promote the health and safety of these athletes and Senate Bill 205 recognizes that we have the ability to greatly diminish the threat of sudden cardiac arrest. Today marks important progress in ensuring Delaware schools are better equipped to prevent and respond to this frightening condition."

Article from Delaware.gov

Article from the Newark Post

As a result of this law, the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association will develop rules for schools to deal with awareness, recognition, and management of sudden cardiac arrest in student-athletes. At a minimum, each school must give coaches and officials information on sudden cardiac arrest, including warning signs.In addition, students and their families will need to sign a sudden cardiac arrest information sheet; athletes will answer questions about heart history before they participate; and schools will ensure all head coaches undergo CPR certification that includes training on the use of an automated external defibrillator.

Words From Our SponsorsBill sponsor Sen. Bethany Hall-Long, D-Middletown, said the law reinforces actions already being taken by the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association. Hall-Long, who authored a law requiring screenings for athletes who may have suffered a concussion, has been on the forefront of protecting the health of young athletes.“Thanks to the tireless efforts of health advocacy groups and of Grace and the Firestone family, we’re here to provide new protection for young athletes,” Hall-Long said “With the training and information this law requires, we’re going to give young athletes a better chance of surviving, if they should suffer a sudden, unexpected cardiac incident while they’re on the field.”

Our Impact“Today, Delaware joined the increasingly pertinent nation-wide movement to provide high-school coaches, parents, and students with lifesaving CPR information,” Firestone said. “Because of persistent legislators and organizations dedicated to raising SCA awareness, Delaware is working to shift the balance to make SCA survival less of a far-reaching miracle and more of a prevailing standard. I will continue to live in gratitude for those family members, policemen, and EMT's who never gave up on my life, and promise to forever work with passion, heart, and purpose to pay that commitment forward.”She attends the University of Delaware and has started a charity to provide athletic equipment to disadvantaged children. At the bill signing, Markell said her story "reminds us why we’re here and it helps inspire us to see that we can do more to protect our kids."At the signing of The Grace Firestone Act is the 9th such bill in the nation. As of November of 2105 there were ONLY NINE states with similar legislation. THAT IS RIDICULOUS.For those from other states who would wish information for your legislators, please connect with me! This is a wonderfully collaborative bill, molded by all the statewide stakeholders AND budget neutral.

Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, co-sponsored the measure, which he hopes will protect young athletes.“It’s shocking to think that these sudden, unexpected heart attacks are the No. 1 killer of young athletes, but that’s the case,” Townsend said. “We know that, in some cases, quick reaction can save the lives of these young people which is why I supported the training this law will require.”Added Sen. Cathy Cloutier, R-Heatherbrooke, “As a member of the General Assembly, it is my responsibility to work on and promote legislation that will serve the people of Delaware, including student athletes. I am honored to have had the opportunity to play a role in SB 205. Because of this bill that’s being signed today, young lives in our state will be saved.”Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek South, also a co-sponsor of the bill, stated, “As a person who has dedicated his entire adult life to running health and fitness clubs and sports programs for our young athletes, I am very proud to have helped champion this important legislation. I believe that we are making a life-saving commitment to our student athletes and their families by enacting this bill.”SB 205 is known as the Grace Firestone Act, named for a former three-sport star at Tower Hill, who also excelled in the classroom, exemplifying the value that athletics can have as part of the educational experience. Now Grace, who attended the bill signing, is one of the rare survivors of Sudden Cardiac Arrest, having collapsed in her home two days after her high school graduation.

Greer Firestone Biography

A phone call at midnight. "Grace had a heart attack". NO! That could not happen to an elite athlete. There was no family heart history. We soon learned that Grace suffered not a heart attack but Sudden Cardiac Arrest. What was that? 

SCA is entirely different. If one is not given CPR/AED within 5 minutes....yes, 5 minutes, the patient either succumbs or suffers cognitive issues and will never be the same.       We did research. We gathered all the stakeholders in Delaware and created The Grace Firestone Act for Sudden Cardiac Awareness, mandated in 2014. However, that was not enough.

We founded Heart In The Game.org that same year to give Delaware students EKG screenings and to train in CPR/AED. 

A pre-participation physical for sports identifies 8% of heart abnormalities. Family history identifies 20%. A simple, 5 minute, non-invasive EKG identifies 90%. Yes, an EKG can save one life. Knowledge of CPR/AED can save tens of lives.

Parents think their otherwise healthy looking kids are invulnerable. The Firestone family certainly thought Grace was invulnerable. You never know. Why take the chance?

Bryan Townsend, D-Newark, co-sponsored the measure, which he hopes will protect young athletes.“It’s shocking to think that these sudden, unexpected heart attacks are the No. 1 killer of young athletes, but that’s the case,” Townsend said. “We know that, in some cases, quick reaction can save the lives of these young people which is why I supported the training this law will require.”Added Sen. Cathy Cloutier, R-Heatherbrooke, “As a member of the General Assembly, it is my responsibility to work on and promote legislation that will serve the people of Delaware, including student athletes. I am honored to have had the opportunity to play a role in SB 205. Because of this bill that’s being signed today, young lives in our state will be saved.”Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek South, also a co-sponsor of the bill, stated, “As a person who has dedicated his entire adult life to running health and fitness clubs and sports programs for our young athletes, I am very proud to have helped champion this important legislation. I believe that we are making a life-saving commitment to our student athletes and their families by enacting this bill.”SB 205 is known as the Grace Firestone Act, named for a former three-sport star at Tower Hill, who also excelled in the classroom, exemplifying the value that athletics can have as part of the educational experience. Now Grace, who attended the bill signing, is one of the rare survivors of Sudden Cardiac Arrest, having collapsed in her home two days after her high school graduation.

Greer Firestone Biography

A phone call at midnight. "Grace had a heart attack". NO! That could not happen to an elite athlete. There was no family heart history. We soon learned that Grace suffered not a heart attack but Sudden Cardiac Arrest. What was that? 

SCA is entirely different. If one is not given CPR/AED within 5 minutes....yes, 5 minutes, the patient either succumbs or suffers cognitive issues and will never be the same.       We did research. We gathered all the stakeholders in Delaware and created The Grace Firestone Act for Sudden Cardiac Awareness, mandated in 2014. However, that was not enough.

We founded Heart In The Game.org that same year to give Delaware students EKG screenings and to train in CPR/AED. 

A pre-participation physical for sports identifies 8% of heart abnormalities. Family history identifies 20%. A simple, 5 minute, non-invasive EKG identifies 90%. Yes, an EKG can save one life. Knowledge of CPR/AED can save tens of lives.

Parents think their otherwise healthy looking kids are invulnerable. The Firestone family certainly thought Grace was invulnerable. You never know. Why take the chance?

Joe Till

Oct 19

Written By Ernest Lundgren

If you’re a Delaware kid in middle school or high school, 15-year-old Joseph Till recommends you make plans to get your heart checked out Saturday.Till, a freshman at Brandywine High School, was among almost 200 kids who showed up for the first “Heart In The Game” cardiac screening at Springer Middle School in January. The second is planned for 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at Alexis I. du Pont High School in Greenville and about 150 kids already are registered, according to organizer Greer Firestone.The free screening includes an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) – a five-minute procedure that gives doctors a record of the heart’s electrical activity. That information can help them detect structural or electrical heart defects that could lead to sudden cardiac arrest. The tests ordinarily would cost $100-150 in a doctor’s office, said Firestone, whose daughter, Gracie, survived a sudden cardiac arrest incident a few years ago.To the Till family, that January test was priceless.“It honestly saved my life,” Till said.After reviewing Till’s electrocardiogram, pediatric cardiologists on site recommended a follow-up appointment, where it was confirmed that Till had Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, a condition that can cause very rapid heart beats.Heart In The Game Founder/Director remembers that day. "It was our first event ever. Joe went through the screening. A pediatric cardiologist from Nemours was on site. He took a look and said 'let's do that one again'. The second screening had the same result. The doc called Joe's father over. 'What is Joe playing now?' Mr. Till said he was on the wrestling team. The doc said 'he must stop wrestling now and you must see a cardiologist next week'. Two weeks later Joe had a 9 hour procedure at Nemours. 6 weeks after that the doc said, 'hit the playing field. You're good to go!'

Written By Ernest Lundgren

After seeing several Heart in the Game advertisements and reading about Greer Firestones daughter, Grace. I decided to register my three youngest sons for a free EKG.Though my sons are healthy and have never showed signs of a heart condition. We have all read or seen the tragic stories in the news of sudden death syndrome in young athletes. My youngest son Zach played multiple sports.I thought this would be a great way to ease my mind. Especially since EKGs currently aren’t part of a typical physical and the event was free of charge.We arrived at the Heart in the Game event on March 19th, 2016 , which was being held at my sons high school, Middletown High School.Everyone was friendly and professional. My three children had their EKG and we were on our way to get ice cream within 40 minutes.On March 28th I received a phone call from a cardiologist at AI DuPont Children Hospital. I was told my 12 year old son Zachs EKG showed an electrical malfunction. He was quickly scheduled for an appointment with cardiologist,Dr Temple. He confirmed Zach had a dangerous pathway in his heart and was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.On April 21, 2016 Zach was scheduled for an ablation to correct the malfunction. My husband and I are eternally grateful for an event like Heart in the Game. A free non evasive EKG that took less than 15 minutes kept our son from possibly being a statistic.Our hope is that one day this will be part of every child’s physical.Jim & Donna Tancredi

Written By Ernest Lundgren

Heart In The Game Foundation was created as a 501(c)3 in 2014. Founder Greer Firestone's daughter Grace suffered Sudden Cardiac Arrest in 2011 at age of 18. Grace was an elite athlete. There was no family heart history. We mandated Grace Firestone Act for Sudden Cardiac Awareness in 2014 and founded Heart In The Game. Over the past 8 years, we have screened over 3500 DE students and trained in CPR/AED over 8000. We are preparing legislation to strengthen The Grace Firestone Act. Our mission is to make Delaware the 'Heart Healthiest" state.View Video

Parent Heart Watch and Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Youth

Oct 19

Written By Ernest Lundgren

Each year thousands of children, teens and young adults suffer Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) or Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD).Research has shown that SCA is the leading cause of death on school property with one student athlete falling victim to SCA every three to four days. Heart disease is the second leading cause of disease-related fatalities in youth according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Learning the Warning Signs and Symptoms, including family history, is critical for the early detection of heart conditions that can lead to SCA. Pediatric Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Assessment When SCA occurs, proper performance of the 5 vital links of the link to "Cardiac Chain of Survival," which includes early defibrillation, can increase survival rates to 60%.View Video

Sudden cardiac arrest in youth is not rare. It's the #1 killer of student athletes and contributes to the #2 medical cause of death under 25, and is the leading cause of death on school campuses. The vision of Parent Heart Watch is to eliminate preventable deaths and disabilities from SCA in youth by 2030. These Parent Heart Watch parents share their personal story of loss to help parents understand the critical need to protect young hearts.View Video
